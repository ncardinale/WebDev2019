    Trying out this website gave me a strange string of responces. I used facebook photos of my family. At first I found it comical, with each selection seeming like a random word for a random face. But eventually, the humor started to fade, and I started to become almost insulted by the words chosen by the words. Each one was arbitrary and random, but the fact that the computer was only judging them by looks almost seemed as if the website was acting how a human acts when they judge people only by a face. Later i learned that that was the design of this website, and created in a very well dont format. The AI in this program shows how we as people tend to act on not only reality, but withing the networked world as well. The programmed AI will title these people we see, and just like anonymous names within the internet, we cannot stop them, nor can we do much to call them out.

    The articles we read, “‘Nerd,’ ‘Nonsmoker,’ ‘Wrongdoer’: How Might A.I. Label You?" talks about this exact program (or AI) and how AI begins to learn, and the problems with AI learning. No matter how well we create a machine, how many nodes that can act like neurons simuulation a brain, a robot can never think or have the emotion of a human, only to simulate it. That is because AI is based on logic, while humans are always based off emotion. It is the reason AI would have massive amounts of trouble acting as a driving or regulating force for other designs. Say this AI would act as a police force, and with this kind of "profiling" we would live in a very distopian society. Now of course, the example i gave is fairly extreme, and there are much more advanced AI in our modern society, but AI have trouble reguarding a grey area of morality and EQ that humans naturally understand, (Though maybe not respond the best).
